This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Practicum 1

This practicum goes through the way of how to make a simple router on Next.js. We begin by cloning a Github repository and running it on a local development server. Then, we make "home" and "about" page, continued by making "profile" page. The code and the result is as follows.

## Practicum 2

This practicum tackles the problem of nested routing. This is done if a link is clicked on a website it will direct the user to the page inside the nested route. The content of the website could be represented in the following screenshots.
